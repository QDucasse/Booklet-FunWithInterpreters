# Booklet-FunWithInterpreters

[![Build status][badge]][travis]

This repository contains the eraly draft of a book on building interpreters for Pharo in Pharo. 
It follows a really simple steps by steps approach. 

Since we are not a native english speaker, we appreciate pull requests that help me get the material in better form.
